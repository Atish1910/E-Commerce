1. Project Walkthrough
“Can you walk us through your project?”

Be ready to explain your file structure, component architecture, routing, and state management approach.

Talk about the tools and libraries you used (e.g., Vite, React Router, Redux, Firebase).

2. API Integration
“How did you fetch and manage data from the Fake Store API?”

Show how you handled loading states, error handling, and pagination or filtering.

Be ready to talk about how you used fetch, axios, or any other method.

3. Authentication
“How did you implement login/signup?”

If you used Firebase, explain how Firebase Authentication works.

They might ask how you secured routes or handled auth state across the app.

4. State Management
“How are you managing state (e.g., cart, auth, products)?”

Whether you used Context API, Redux, Zustand, or just local component state, be clear and specific.

5. UI/UX and Responsiveness
“How did you ensure your UI is responsive and user-friendly?”

Discuss CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) or media queries.

Talk about mobile-first design or custom animations if applicable.

6. Code Quality
“What practices did you follow for clean code?”

Mention things like folder structure, naming conventions, reusable components, and comments.

If you used ESLint or Prettier, bring that up.

7. Deployment
“Where did you deploy the app and how?”

Be prepared to talk about Vercel/Netlify setup, environment variables, and build optimization.

8. Challenges & Problem-Solving
“What were the biggest challenges you faced and how did you overcome them?”

Be honest and highlight any issue with API, state sync, auth bugs, or layout bugs—and how you solved them.

9. Bonus Feature Questions (if implemented)
Search, filters, reviews, animations: they might ask why and how you added them.

10. Security & Best Practices
“How do you handle form validation?”

“How do you protect user data?”
